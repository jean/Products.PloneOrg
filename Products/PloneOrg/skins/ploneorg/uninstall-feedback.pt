<h1>Uninstalling Plone?</h1>

<div class="documentDescription">
This form lets you submit some feedback as to why you are uninstalling Plone. 
This will allow us to make Plone better, and we appreciate constructive comments.
</div>

<div class="discreet">
There's no need to submit this form if you're only doing a routine reinstall or move of servers, 
and you don't have to submit the form to complete the uninstall. It's just a convenience function
for the Plone Team to get feedback from people that chose to not use Plone. Feel free to just close 
this browser window if you don't have anything you want to tell us. :)
</div>

<p>Thank you for trying Plone. Please provide us with feedback from your experience.
With your comments can we improve the Plone product.</p>
<p>Any personal information given will only be used to contact you in case we need more info
about your comments. They will not be used for anything else. The mail goes to
a shared and spam-filtered mailing list, though &mdash; so make sure you don't
include any confidential information.
