Profiles
--------

Base
~~~~

The base buildout is good enough to run Plone::

    $ python2.6 bootstrap.py -d
    $ bin/buildout
    $ bin/instance fg

Develop
~~~~~~~

WARNING: According to aclark, this does not work. eleddy got it up and 
running by adding plone.app.registry to the develop.cfg eggs list so until
someone agrees on how to fix that either manually do that or use something else.

A development buildout with trunk checkouts of all of plone.org's dependencies 
can be built with::

    $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout -c conf/develop.cfg
    $ bin/instance fg

Staging
~~~~~~~

WARNING: This is not tested and likely to be broken (via aclark)!

A staging buildout, designed to configure a new plone.org alongside the
current, can be built with::

    $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout -c conf/staging.cfg
    $ bin/instance fg

Production
~~~~~~~~~~

A production build, suitable for running on plone.org can be built with::

    $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout -c conf/production.cfg
    $ bin/instance fg

Database
~~~~~~~~

If you need the Data.fs and CatalogData.fs files from plone.org, and you have 
a plone.org account, you can do this::

    $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout -c conf/database.cfg
    $ bin/instance fg
